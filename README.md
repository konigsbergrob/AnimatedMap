Title: Real Time Bus Tracker mixed with Rob Konigsberg

Description: This map has 2 different buttons. The first one showcases places that the author (Rob Konigsberg) has lived over the years, and stops in his current location (does not keep cycling). The second button, using an API, pulls in data about where certain buses are in Massachussetts. Every 15 seconds this data is received, and markers are created showing where each bus is. Additionally, all prior markers are deleted every 15 seconds. 

How to Run: Save all 3 files (not incl. this file) to the same folder and drag index.html into a browser. 

Roadmap of future improvements: Color coding the markers depending on different situations (e.g. places I lived while in college would be different color than now). Also a way of receiving a user input of an address, and then finding a way to calculate which bus is closest and when it may arrive. This can be done by taking two instances of data (15 seconds apart), measuring distance to a certain address, and seeing if it changes to assess if the bus is in the right direction.
